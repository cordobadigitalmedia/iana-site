      ### Are there any fees?


      No, there are no hidden fees. There are no administrative fees, no late
      fees, or any other fees. Borrowers are given loans in good faith and
      required to pay back only what they borrow, not a penny more. Borrowers
      may pay fees to third parties in order to transfer funds to Iana (e.g., to
      mail cheques or to send wire transfers). Iana does not make ANY profit.
      Any donations or gifts given to Iana go to help advance Iana’s work and to
      providing more interest-free loans – no strings attached. By the grace of
      God, Iana is a community service that is entirely run by volunteers who
      cover all administrative fees.


      ### Are international applicants eligible?


      Yes, international applicants are eligible and have been awarded loans.
      However, preference goes to those from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, then
      other applicants from Canada, the United States, and Europe, then other
      countries. What is more important than geographic considerations is giving
      a loan to the right person for the right reasons. See our [Award
      Philosophy](http://ianafinancial.org/award-philosophy/) for more
      information. You can also explore the many other organizations that
      provide support on page for [Relief
      Organizations](http://ianafinancial.org/relief-organizations).


      ### What types of loans are available?


      1. Iana Learn is for educational loans, tuition, and other expenses
      related to pursuing studies or to paying off existing student loans.

      2. Iana Personal is for emergency or short-term loans for those who have
      urgent needs or unanticipated expenses (e.g. dental, medical, auto, etc.)
      as well as important vehicle purchases, or home renovations.

      3. Iana Independence is to help small businesses get on their feet or
      expand their operations.

      4. Iana Community is for non-profit organizations and institutions and
      their work.


      ### How do applicants apply?


      1. First, email us the answers to the preliminary application questions.
      You may not receive an answer at all or for an extended period of time due
      to the volume of emails we receive. If pre-approved, you will, insha’Allah
      (God-willing) be asked to proceed to the following step.

      2. Second, submit the final application forms and all required
      documentation. Loans are given directly to the applicant (not to parents,
      schools or outside agencies). All additional information must be supplied
      for the committee to consider your application.

      3. Third, a personal interview will be required as well as reference
      checks.

      4. Finally, if any requirements are not satisfied or documentation is
      missing, the application may be denied.


      ### How are applicants assessed?


      Applications are reviewed through a rigorous process devised by Islamic
      and Western finance experts. The process is a combination of a thorough
      application review, documentation, reference checks, an interview,
      potentially a credit check, [praying for guidance or
      istikhara](http://seekershub.org/ans-blog/2015/07/03/istikhara-the-prayer-of-seeking-guidance/)
      and more; all to try to ensure the applicants are responsible,
      trustworthy, prudent, competent and will inshaAllah (God-willing)
      successfully repay their loans so that others may in turn be given loans.


      ### What are some reasons a loan application may be rejected?


      There are many reasons why an application may be denied but the most
      common reason stems from basic logistics of cash-flow needs, depending on
      the loan amount requested and its duration. This must be measured against
      the needs of the community members who have entrusted Iana by lending
      their savings (e.g. for Hajj, a home, children’s education, retirement,
      etc.). In addition to this, it is very difficult to weigh various
      applications while also considering things like: the strength and merit of
      the application, the perceived individual needs along with societal
      benefit, and the character of the applicant (e.g., honesty and
      competence). Other factors also play a role. For instance, when an
      application lacks information or does not list a guarantor, it is less
      likely to be approved. We hope you understand and ask you to pray that
      Allah enables us to give and withhold in accordance with His Pleasure.


      Loan applications may be rejected for the following reasons:


      * Incomplete application or missing supporting documents

      * Insufficient funds available

      * Disagreement in establishing repayment schedule

      * Guarantors unwilling to co-sign (if applicable)

      * Poor judgement or poor character displayed by applicant

      * Other reasons deemed appropriate by Iana Financial


      Please note that the funds Iana has are a trust from those who have
      donated or loaned money to Iana, as such, we are fully accountable for the
      responsible management of these funds. We take our role seriously and have
      both a right and responsibility to deny an application at our discretion.


      ### When is the deadline for applications and how long does the process
      take?


      Applications are accepted year-round, on a rolling basis. There is no
      deadline for submitting an application. Once an application is submitted,
      the response will, inshā’Allah, be given as soon as possible. Please plan
      accordingly and submit your request early, while continuing to explore and
      pursue other options.


      Loans may be given within days, weeks, or months depending on many
      factors. We ask you to keep in mind that Iana is a volunteer team with no
      paid staff. We do our best to process applications as best we can.


      ### How does loan repayment work?


      Iana Financial highly depends upon the repayment of loans in order to
      continue to help people meet their needs. It is important that applicants
      recognize there is a moral obligation as well as a legal obligation to
      repay any loan that he or she may receive. As such, signing the loan
      agreement is required to ensure the terms are clear to both parties. For
      accountability and practicality, a loan repayment plan is set on a
      case-by-case basis.


      ### What if the borrower fails to make a payment for repaying their loan?


      Delays in repayment place a burden on Iana and delay much-needed help to
      others who are applying for loans. As such, we strongly emphasize the need
      for borrowers to honourably fulfill their contractual repayment plans.
      However, as long as notice is given and an exceptional situation is
      explained, a rare late payment would simply be deferred. There are never
      any late fees.


      Repeatedly missing payments may result in the loan defaulting. In this
      case, guarantors will be contacted to resume payments and if this is
      unsuccessful, Iana will take the case to arbitration. If the borrower is
      uncooperative, Iana may make the case public in order to help recover
      funds, or may take legal action to recover Iana Financial’s (i.e. the
      community’s) assets.


      However, we try to mitigate this as much as possible by being careful in
      how we select borrowers in the first place. The front-end work — a
      thorough application and vetting process — will, inshā’Allah, protect
      against this eventuality. By the grace of God, we do our utmost and rely
      on Him all the while.


      ### What is the role of the guarantor?


      The guarantor is fully liable to repay the entire loan or whatever balance
      remains in case the borrower is unable to fulfill their contractual
      obligations or if the borrower is unwilling to renegotiate their loan
      repayment plan in the case of default. The guarantor should have a high
      level of confidence that the borrower is an upright, honest, and competent
      person who will do everything they can to honour their word.
