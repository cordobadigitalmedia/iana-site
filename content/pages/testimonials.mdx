      > Iana Financial is a genuine, much-needed initiative that offers sound
      and ethical financial solutions to the Muslim community and
      society-at-large. Iana Financial is serious about making a difference,
      that’s why I offered my time and services during the development of Iana,
      and that’s why I continue to advise and consult the management of Iana
      Financial on their path forward. I support this initiative and encourage
      you to support it as well with prayers, donations, and time; together,
      with God’s Help, we can make this initiative a success.

      > We live in a society with interest…prevalent in everything that we do.
      People will gladly give you a loan, if they could get some interest, but
      here is an organization that has no interest, literally, no interest, and
      no interest in charging interest. And it’s a fantastic idea. I love them.
      I love the concept and may Allah Subhanu wa Ta’ala bless them. I want you
      to support them in any way that you can. You can not imagine the number of
      people who benefit. \[I]t’s a very novel idea, it’s a great idea, I
      support them one hundred percent, and may Allah…make them successful, and
      please, please, please, help them in anyway you can.

      > Greed, greed and more greed; this is our modern world. In these days of
      “self-love” beyond everything else, you can find brothers and sisters
      dedicated to give back, to help, to alleviate–Iana is that organization
      ready to trample on greed and gluttony, your help is most needed. Iana is
      a project that we all should support, giving back a few dollars is a way
      of getting much more.


      > Why not let your monies be a source of constant goodness for you? When
      you support Iana, you support the Ummah.


      > In times that we live in, what a shining example can an organization
      like Iana be; while banks lacerate the human, Iana gives a goodly loan to
      let people stand back on their feet without having to worry to pay back
      triple of what they borrowed– what a sound investment for the Hereafter.
      Just imagine, you donate $5000 dollars, a struggling student receives it.
      That student gets educated, stands on their feet, pays back, and… the
      beauty, your money is given to another and another. How will this look on
      the Day of Judgment– MOST HANDSOME.


      > All my love and support for Iana, what a beautiful endeavor.”

      > Iana Financial is a sincere, courageous, and proactive initiative that
      offers a concrete way to help those in need. To me, Iana is a crucial
      means to reviving the all-but-forgotten meaning of: community.


      – Sheikh Tamir Ali, Resident Scholar, Edmonton


      > Students from our community have few choices when it comes to financing
      their education. Either they must work, must borrow or excel at their
      studies such that they receive scholarships and / or bursaries.This is
      where initiatives such as Iana Financial can be most helpful. By
      alleviating some of the stress associated with borrowing at interest under
      restrictive covenants, Iana loans will IA allow students to follow their
      academic dreams a bit further. This will IA allow young members of the
      community to redevelop and further their joy of learning and allow us as
      Muslims to further contribute positively to humanity. Let us make no
      mistake here – what is at stake is not just interest relief for some
      students, but rather the bottom-up redevelopment of our community on a
      more sophisticated, educated and ethical foundation. Thus, I ask you to
      join with me in congratulating the founders of Iana for this wonderful
      initiative and helping do whatever it takes to ensure its growth and
      success across Canada.

      > The work being done by Iana financial is honest, sincere, and filled
      with integrity. This organization serves as a shining example of what our
      community is capable of. By providing interest free loans, Iana financial
      is supporting the Muslim community at a caliber that I haven’t seen
      before, and it is our responsibility to see to it that their efforts are
      supported.

      > Living in a world that seems to be driven by interest, IANA is a
      refreshing organization that is aiding Muslims by providing them interest
      free loans. Trying to stay away from interest bearing loans myself, I was
      referred to IANA by a friend and am very relieved that such an
      organization exists. It is very important for us, as Muslims, to support
      organizations such as IANA, as they are not only helping benefit us in
      this dunya, but inshAllah in the aakhira as well.

      > Iana Financial has been instrumental in allowing me to keep my personal
      values and beliefs while attaining my education. Before Iana…it was
      difficult to find ways to finance my education as I would have to find a
      way to pay back student loans before accumulating interest. Thanks to
      opportunities like this I am able to pursue my goals without compromising
      my beliefs.
