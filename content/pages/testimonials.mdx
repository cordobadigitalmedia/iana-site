      > We live in a society with interest…prevalent in everything that we do.
      People will gladly give you a loan, if they could get some interest, but
      here is an organization that has no interest, literally, no interest, and
      no interest in charging interest. And it’s a fantastic idea. I love them.
      I love the concept and may Allah Subhanu wa Ta’ala bless them. I want you
      to support them in any way that you can. You can not imagine the number of
      people who benefit. \[I]t’s a very novel idea, it’s a great idea, I
      support them one hundred percent, and may Allah…make them successful, and
      please, please, please, help them in anyway you can.
