      #### The example of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is
      like a seed \[of grain] which grows seven spikes; in each spike is a
      hundred grains. And Allah multiplies \[His reward] for whom He wills. And
      Allah is all-Encompassing and Knowing.


      Holy Qur’an (2:261)

      <Alert description="You will notice that we have no online donation
      feature. If we are serious about grassroots economic reform to get us out
      of this modern financial catastrophe, we need to take the inconvenient
      steps that such a principled approach demands. Each year the Muslim
      community, and the broader community, of North America literally throw
      away millions of dollars to credit card companies and banks rather than to
      the good causes they intend to help simply for the convenience of paying
      by credit. Our entire society suffers as a result. Let us take the extra
      effort and discipline to save our money and pay by cash, cheque, debit or
      direct deposit. Not only is this the better thing to do financially but,
      more importantly, God will appreciate our efforts to avoid supporting a
      corrupt system that impoverishes countless people around the world. The
      blessings of such actions will more than compensate for the inconvenience,
      God-willing." type="info" title="Note on credit card donations" />
