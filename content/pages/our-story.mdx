      In the Name of Allah, All-Compassionate, All-Merciful, All Praise and
      Thanks are due to Allah, and all Blessings and Peace upon His Prophet,
      Muhammad, the one through whom we are all helped.


      > Whoever relieves a believer from a worldly burden, Allah will relieve
      him from a burden of the Hereafter. Whoever alleviates the situation of a
      person in difficulty, Allah will alleviate his situation in this world and
      in the Hereafter. Whoever conceals the faults of a Muslim, Allah will
      conceal his faults in this world and in the Hereafter. Allah will be at
      the aid of His servant so long as that servant is at the aid of his
      brother….\[Authentic hadith compiled by Imam Muslim, Allah have mercy on
      him]


      Iana Financial is an interest-free lending program inspired by a good
      deed: a few people in Edmonton loaned money to help a sister who was
      struggling with her student debt and did not want to fall into
      interest/usury. After lending, they did not want the money back! Once her
      loan was paid back, that money was to go to help someone else. From this
      spirit of help, Iana Financial was born. Since \~2009, Allah, Most High,
      has blessed Iana to support a number of people.


      Based on Qur'anic and Prophetic teachings, Iana takes donations and loans
      from community and gives loans to community.  Interest-free.


      Iana is a non-profit organization whose vision is to be at the heart of a
      fair, balanced, and merciful, modern economic system, in line with the
      principles and teachings of Islam.  Iana is an Arabic word meaning “help”
      or “assistance”. 


      Kindly pray that God accepts these efforts and brings about much benefit
      and goodness through them.
