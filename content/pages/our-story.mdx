      Iana Financial is an interest-free lending program inspired by a good
      deed: a few people in the Edmonton community gave some money to help a
      sister who was struggling with her student debt. But they did not want
      that money back! Once her loan was paid back, that money was to go to help
      someone else. From this spirit of help, Iana Financial was born. Since
      2008 Allah has blessed Iana to support a number of people. Alhamdulillah
      our work keeps gaining momentum: more donations are coming in and more
      applications; please continue your sincere prayers for this beneficial
      service to grow and flourish.


      Iana is an Arabic word meaning “help”or “assistance”. To help is at the
      core of Iana’s existence; Iana provides financial services that ease
      peoples’ financial burdens. Iana is a non-profit organization whose vision
      is to be at the heart of a fair, balanced, and merciful, modern economic
      system. Iana aims to provide these services to society in light of our
      Islamic principles and ideals.


      Iana currently offers two types of interest-free loans: Iana Learn is an
      education interest-free lending program. Whether someone is an
      undergraduate or graduate student, or whether they seek to take part-time
      courses, or to simply pay off their existing student loans, Iana Financial
      may be able to help. Iana Now is an interest-free lending program for
      small, short-term loans for those who have had an unanticipated expense
      (e.g. dental, medical, auto) they cannot handle and need a little help for
      a short while. See the Apply page for more information.


      We encourage you to sign-up as a monthly donor, with your support, many
      will be helped inshaAllah.


      We ask Allah (God) to accept our efforts and to help many people through
      this initiative.


      > Whosoever relieves a believer from a worldly burden, Allah will relieve
      him from a burden of the Hereafter. Whosoever alleviates the situation of
      a person in difficulty, Allah will alleviate his situation in this world
      and in the Hereafter. Whosoever conceals the faults of a Muslim, Allah
      will conceal his faults in this world and in the Hereafter. Allah will
      continue to aid a servant (of His) so long as that servant continues to
      aid his brother….
