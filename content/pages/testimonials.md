> Iana Financial is a genuine, much-needed initiative that offers sound and ethical financial solutions to the Muslim community and society-at-large. Iana Financial is serious about making a difference, that's why I offered my time and services during the development of Iana, and that's why I continue to advise and consult the management of Iana Financial on their path forward. I support this initiative and encourage you to support it as well with prayers, donations, and time; together, with God's Help, we can make this initiative a success.

> We live in a society with interest…prevalent in everything that we do. People will gladly give you a loan, if they could get some interest, but here is an organization that has no interest, literally, no interest, and no interest in charging interest. And it's a fantastic idea. I love them. I love the concept and may Allah Subhanu wa Ta'ala bless them. I want you to support them in any way that you can. You can not imagine the number of people who benefit. \[I]t's a very novel idea, it's a great idea, I support them one hundred percent, and may Allah…make them successful, and please, please, please, help them in anyway you can.

> Greed, greed and more greed; this is our modern world. In these days of "self-love" beyond everything else, you can find brothers and sisters dedicated to give back, to help, to alleviate–Iana is that organization ready to trample on greed and gluttony, your help is most needed. Iana is a project that we all should support, giving back a few dollars is a way of getting much more.


> Why not let your monies be a source of constant goodness for you? When you support Iana, you support the Ummah.


> In times that we live in, what a shining example can an organization like Iana be; while banks lacerate the human, Iana gives a goodly loan to let people stand back on their feet without having to worry to pay back triple of what they borrowed– what a sound investment for the Hereafter. Just imagine, you donate $5000 dollars, a struggling student receives it. That student gets educated, stands on their feet, pays back, and… the beauty, your money is given to another and another. How will this look on the Day of Judgment– MOST HANDSOME.


> All my love and support for Iana, what a beautiful endeavor."


> Your brother in service of Deen

> Iana Financial is a sincere, courageous, and proactive initiative that offers a concrete way to help those in need. To me, Iana is a crucial means to reviving the all-but-forgotten meaning of: community.

> Students from our community have few choices when it comes to financing their education. Either they must work, must borrow or excel at their studies such that they receive scholarships and / or bursaries.This is where initiatives such as Iana Financial can be most helpful. By alleviating some of the stress associated with borrowing at interest under restrictive covenants, Iana loans will IA allow students to follow their academic dreams a bit further. This will IA allow young members of the community to redevelop and further their joy of learning and allow us as Muslims to further contribute positively to humanity. Let us make no mistake here – what is at stake is not just interest relief for some students, but rather the bottom-up redevelopment of our community on a more sophisticated, educated and ethical foundation. Thus, I ask you to join with me in congratulating the founders of Iana for this wonderful initiative and helping do whatever it takes to ensure its growth and success across Canada.

> The work being done by Iana financial is honest, sincere, and filled with integrity. This organization serves as a shining example of what our community is capable of. By providing interest free loans, Iana financial is supporting the Muslim community at a caliber that I haven't seen before, and it is our responsibility to see to it that their efforts are supported.

> Living in a world that seems to be driven by interest, IANA is a refreshing organization that is aiding Muslims by providing them interest free loans. Trying to stay away from interest bearing loans myself, I was referred to IANA by a friend and am very relieved that such an organization exists. It is very important for us, as Muslims, to support organizations such as IANA, as they are not only helping benefit us in this dunya, but inshAllah in the aakhira as well.

> Iana Financial has been instrumental in allowing me to keep my personal values and beliefs while attaining my education. Before Iana…it was difficult to find ways to finance my education as I would have to find a way to pay back student loans before accumulating interest. Thanks to opportunities like this I am able to pursue my goals without compromising my beliefs.
