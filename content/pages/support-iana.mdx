          Saving with Iana is an effective way to save your money while helping
          others. Whether saving for Hajj, towards purchasing a home, for your
          children’s education, or retirement, you can lend money to Iana at an
          agreed time-frame or year-by-year.


          It’s simple: contact us specifying the loan amount, duration and a few
          other details, we prepare a loan agreement, once signed, you transfer
          the funds to Iana, and we use those funds to help people with
          interest-free loans. At the end of the agreed duration, we pay you
          back – it’s that simple!


          If you prefer to go year by year, each year you are given an
          opportunity to schedule a withdrawal of your savings.


          A detailed contract is available for your review – we believe you will
          agree that it is flexible, fair, and reasonable.


          This option is far more rewarding than keeping your money in the bank
          – rather than helping banks lend your money at interest, let Iana help
          people interest-free!
