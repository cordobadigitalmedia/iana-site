      Many people need financial help for a short while and most places take
      advantage of their situation by charging them interest/usury.


      You can help change this, insha'Allah.

          ### The example of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is
          like a seed \[of grain] which grows seven spikes; in each spike is a
          hundred grains. And Allah multiplies \[His reward] for whom He wills.
          And Allah is all-Encompassing and Knowing.


          Holy Qur’an (2:261)


          * We do not have charitable status: Your donation will not receive a
          tax-receipt. Instead of tax-receipts, God’s gifts are immediate and
          ever-lasting and come in many shapes and colours!

          * Donations will be used to further Iana Financial’s vision: This
          includes providing interest-free loans as well as other initiatives
          related to Islamic financial community services such as education
          initiatives or loan forgiveness.

          * Every penny counts: Every contribution goes to the pool of funds
          while all administrative are covered by Iana volunteers.


          How to Donate: 


          1. Directly to Iana’s Servus Credit Union Account – Walk into any
          Servus Credit Union and donate directly to Iana Financial under the
          account number: 5176250. **Please leave a memo with your donation
          indicating your name.**

          Lending Iana is an effective way to save your money while helping
          others. Whether saving for Hajj, towards purchasing a home, for your
          children’s education, or retirement.


          It’s simple:


          1. Contact us to setup your account and a loan agreement.

          2. Transfer funds to Iana as often as you like via e-transfer or
          cheque (these funds help your brothers and sisters with interest-free
          loans).

          3. When you need any funds back, simply reach out and we pay you back
          via e-transfer or wire insha'Allah – easy!


          Contact us for more information - email
          [support-iana@ianafinancial.org](mailto\:support-iana@ianafinancial.org).


          This option is far more rewarding than keeping your money in the bank
          – rather than helping banks lend your money at interest, let Iana help
          people interest-free!
