          ### The example of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is
          like a seed \[of grain] which grows seven spikes; in each spike is a
          hundred grains. And Allah multiplies \[His reward] for whom He wills.
          And Allah is all-Encompassing and Knowing.


          Holy Qur’an (2:261)


          * We do not have charitable status: Your donation will not receive a
          tax-receipt. Instead of tax-receipts, God’s gifts are immediate and
          ever-lasting and come in many shapes and colours!

          * Donations will be used to further Iana Financial’s vision: This
          includes providing interest-free loans as well as other initiatives
          related to Islamic financial community services such as education
          initiatives.

          * Every penny counts: Every contribution goes to the pool of funds
          while all administrative are covered by Iana volunteers.

          Saving with Iana is an effective way to save your money while helping
          others. Whether saving for Hajj, towards purchasing a home, for your
          children’s education, or retirement, you can lend money to Iana at an
          agreed time-frame or year-by-year.


          It’s simple: contact us specifying the loan amount, duration and a few
          other details, we prepare a loan agreement, once signed, you transfer
          the funds to Iana, and we use those funds to help people with
          interest-free loans. At the end of the agreed duration, we pay you
          back – it’s that simple!


          If you prefer to go year by year, each year you are given an
          opportunity to schedule a withdrawal of your savings.


          A detailed contract is available for your review – we believe you will
          agree that it is flexible, fair, and reasonable.


          This option is far more rewarding than keeping your money in the bank
          – rather than helping banks lend your money at interest, let Iana help
          people interest-free!

      ## Study


      We believe that money will not solve our personal or global problems.
      Rather, a sincere returning to our Lord and our true purpose in life is
      what we need to set things right in our personal lives, in our families,
      communities, and the world. Such a tawbah (repentance) requires with it
      sound knowledge on how things ought to be to restore the sacred balance on
      earth.
