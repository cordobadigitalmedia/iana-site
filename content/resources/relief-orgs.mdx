  <Alert description="If you are applying for a loan from Iana, you must confirm
  whether or not you have approached these or similar organizations for
  scholarships, interest-free loans, aid, or zakat." title="Zakat" type="info"
  />


  Iana is not linked, directly or indirectly, to any other community
  organization, mosque, or corporation. Iana stands independent and welcomes
  collaboration and cooperation with any who share similar values and vision.
  Any reference to other organizations is based on their commitment to doing
  good work as well as the people behind them. We advise each individual to do
  their own independent research and to consult before making decisions related
  to such organizations or people. Similarly, wherever we recommend specific
  books, articles, or websites, we still suggest each person consults qualified
  scholarship and conducts independent research. We pray for the guidance to
  make educated decisions regarding what knowledge to take and from whom, and
  the success to implement righteous action based on that knowledge.


  Iana in no way endorses any person or idea that contradict the sacred
  teachings of Islam embodied in the Holy Qur’an, the sunnah (traditions) of the
  Prophet ﷺ and the unanimous teachings of the scholars over the centuries who
  were and are the inheritors of his way. Iana does recognize that there are
  healthy and normative differences within our beautiful community, and that
  this is a mercy from our Lord ﷻ to be celebrated not censured. Iana also looks
  to take pearls of wisdom from anyone, including people of other faith
  traditions.
